# TODO List Application

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a versatile TODO list application that enhances personal management by incorporating real-time weather and geolocation functionalities. At its core, the application is dedicated to providing users with a seamless platform for organizing, prioritizing, and navigating through their daily tasks, while offering real-time weather updates based on the user's specific location. Leveraging the robust capabilities of React Native, this app promises to deliver a consistent and dynamic user interface across multiple platforms, ensuring quick response times and an enhanced user experience. The project comes equipped with features such as home page access to real-time weather, temperature, photo uploading, text adding, item modification, sharing, and location viewing.

## Key Features

- **Home Page**: View real-time weather and temperature, upload photos, add text, modify and share items, and see locations.
- **Framework Building Module Technology**: Developed with React Native for cross-platform UI consistency and performance.

## Getting Started

To set up the TODO List Application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- You should have Node.js installed on your system.
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn should be available for managing packages.
- Expo CLI should be installed for running the application.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TODO-List-Application.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd TODO-List-Application
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```
   or if you use Yarn:
   ```sh
