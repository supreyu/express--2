# TaskMaster

**TaskMaster** is a React Native-based mobile application designed to enhance productivity and organization through a secure and intuitive task management experience. Incorporating biometric authentication, real-time location services, and the ability to attach images to tasks, TaskMaster goes beyond traditional task management to assist in organizing your daily life more effectively and securely.

## Features

- **Biometric Authentication**: Utilizes Expo's `LocalAuthentication` for secure access to your tasks.
- **Real-Time Location Services**: Integrates Expo's `Location` API to tag tasks with your current location, providing additional context.
- **Image Attachments**: Allows attaching images to tasks using Expo's `ImagePicker`, enriching task details.
- **Seamless Navigation**: Employs React Navigation for fluid movement between screens within the app.
